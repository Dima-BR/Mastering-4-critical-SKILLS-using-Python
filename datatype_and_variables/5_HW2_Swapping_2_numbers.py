# Homework 2: Swapping 2 numbers!
# ● Write a program that reads 2 integers num1 and num2
# ○ E.g. say we read num1 = 7 and num2 = 25
# ● Target: we want swap the values of num1 and num2?
# ○ Swap means exchange
# ○ So Num1 has value 25 and Num2 has value 7
# ○ Write 3 lines of code only

num1, num2 = map(int, input().split())

num3 = num1
num1 = num2
num2 = num3

print(num1, num2)
